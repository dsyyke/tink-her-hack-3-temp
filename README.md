### Project Description
ONE-EVENT is a web app that centralizes all campus events, allowing students to view and register for events from various student communities. Admins can manage events, while students easily stay updated and engaged with campus activities.

### The Problem statement
The problem is that campus events from different student communities are scattered across various platforms, and most students are unaware of these events, making it difficult for them to stay updated and register. 

### The Solution
ONE -EVENT solves this by providing a centralized platform where all campus events can be viewed and registered for, ensuring better visibility and access, with admin functionality for easy event management.
